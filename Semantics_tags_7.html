🧠 One-Line Memory Trick (Interview Hack)
        
Header = top
Nav = menu
Main = main content
Section = group
Article = independent content
Aside = side info
Footer = bottom
        
Memorize this → you already know semantics.

        🏆 Example Real Page Structure

<=header>
  <=nav>
    <=main>
       <=section>
    <=article>
  <=aside>
<=footer>
    </code>
</pre>                 
 

<pre>
This is real professional structure.
                        
✅ Important Truth:
You don’t need deep theory.
If you can correctly place these tags → you already know semantics.
                        
                        
there is no fix structure or syntax like programming language we can place any anywhere if it has Meanings.
so we don’t have to fear this........
